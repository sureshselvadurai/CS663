 - gradient decent algo
 - draw a random line and move towards the required slopr and intercept
 - if intercept constant, slopt variation with residue is a parabols. find the dy/dx is zero is the point where slop is minimum
 - learning rate - multiply the difference by a small number to make the movement delta
 - batch gradienct daya, take a batch and keep updating
 - random - stocasting - moves like a drunk person on a walk to min
 - min batch gradience decent - batched of n sizeds
