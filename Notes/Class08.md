 - Linear Regession
 - parametic or not depends o wherther continuoys function of not
 - regression  - comes from moves towards medeo, or avergae
 - on intrepetability
 - lasso, least squares, additive trees, bagging, boosting , SVM
 - incease bias, decreas variance
 - bias -  assumptions about data, like linear
 - variance - the rror
 - overfitting and underfitting
 - linear, x on y , residues have a normal distribution,. no corr betwee nn consucutibe
 - homoscedacity
   - data diverges with time . so resudues depends on x
 - BROWTN FOURTH TEST
 - PLOT RESIDUES OVER X AND ITS scattered all over
 -  R goodness of fit : 
 - R^2 variance of model and varience of y
   - v model - var
