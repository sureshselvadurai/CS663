 - 8 clustering algo
 - k means - needs to know clusters
 - db scan  - have noises
 - hyperparamerts for dbscan p neigbourhood subs, radius and number of points
 - corr point and reachable points based on poliferation
 - cluster lables in db scan is minus 1
 - grid search and find min
 - grid search approach
 - dbscan - curse of dimentialnilty - more dimension then distance increases then clustering becomes easier
 - densities should be similar
 - density scaling

 * horachial clustering
 * distnace between clusters
 * avergae - max - take the max distace between points. wads, sum of square distance
 * dendrogram - for clinkage fig
 *
